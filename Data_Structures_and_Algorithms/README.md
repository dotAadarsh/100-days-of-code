## Data Structures

> Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets are the Four Horsemen of Data Structures in Python.

 - **List**: Ordered, Mutable collections of Data, enclosed by square brackets [ ], and use commas to separate their values. They can contain different data types, repeated values and are iterable
 - **Tuples**: Ordered, Immutable collections of Data, and are the default data type in Python. Immutable means that they can’t be modified and items can’t be added or deleted. The data is enclosed in parenthesis ().
 - **Dictionaries**: Unordered, Mutable collections of data, where the data is stored in the form of key:value pairs.
 - **Sets**: Unordered, mutable collections of data, which can’t contain repeated values. They can take different data types, and are enclosed by curly braces {}.
